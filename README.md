## My Game Idea

Top down, you are in space. You play as a little star. You try to collect these other "masses" floating around and each time you do you grow bigger. However, you are constantly shrinking, so you have to collect mass fast enough to gain more than you loose. You wait too long and you die out. Gain mass too fast and you get so big that you collapse into a black hole.

Controls:
Two button controls, one moves you along X axis and the other moves you along Y axis. They invert direction everytime you gain mass.
